# Perch Developer Platform

Welcome to the **Perch Developer Platform** ‚Äî a suite of APIs and tools that enable partners to deliver exceptional digital mortgage experiences for their clients. Our platform is designed to give you secure, programmatic access to key Perch services so you can integrate mortgage workflows directly into your product.

In its simplest form, Perch's Partner API is a realtime gateway that provides partners with a simple way to refer mortgage seekers to Perch and track their progress as they move through the mortgage application lifecycle.

## What the Partner API enables

The **Partner API** allows you to:

1. ü§ù **Submit leads**: Seamlessly hand off your clients to Perch for their mortgage needs
2. üëÄ **Track applications**: Get real-time visibility into the status of your client's mortgage journey  
3. üîî **Receive updates**: Stay in sync as applications move forward, with key event notifications and status changes

### Benefits of programmatic lead submission

By providing client details programmatically, partners can:

- **Personalize the experience** - Client data is pre-populated, reducing friction
- **Expedite applications** - Clients don't need to re-enter information they've already provided
- **Dramatically reduce barriers** to lead conversion
- **Track progress** - Monitor both Lead and Plan status through dedicated endpoints
- **Increase conversion rates** - Our data shows significantly higher success rates vs traditional referral channels

## Why use the API instead of referral links?

Perch has a long-standing referral ecosystem using referral code links and landing pages. While these channels provide reliable lead attribution, they typically yield suboptimal conversion results because they are:

- **Not personalized** to the specific client
- **Untethered from automation** and integration  
- **Limited visibility** - partners lack insight into whether leads actually convert

This is where our API transforms the experience. Instead of directing clients to generic landing pages, partners can directly and securely submit client details to Perch, triggering our tailored onboarding experience ‚Äî a refined combination of automation and customer experience intervention that yields substantially higher funding success rates.
