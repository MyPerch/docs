description: "Learn how to authenticate with the Perch Partner API using API keys"
---

To use the Perch Partner API, you must authenticate each request with an API key that identifies your application and proves that the request is authorized. The authentication process is simple and stateless — just supply one header with each request.

## Overview

Every API request must include the following header:

- `X-API-Key` - Authenticates your request and identifies your firm

<Note>
The API key header is required for every request to the Partner API.
</Note>

## Steps to obtain and use an API key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Perch for API access">
    Reach out to the Perch team at [partnersupport@myperch.io](mailto:partnersupport@myperch.io) to request API access for your organization. During this process, you'll need to provide:
    
    - Your business information and use case
    - The type of integration you're planning (lead submission, tracking, etc.)
    - Whether you need sandbox or production access (or both)
    
    <Info>
    We recommend starting with sandbox access to test your integration before moving to production.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive your API key">
    Our team will provision a long-lived API key tied to your firm record. This key acts as a permanent access token and must be included in the `X-API-Key` header with every request.
    
    You'll also receive:
    - Your specific API domain (sandbox or production)
    - Documentation specific to your use case
    - Any additional configuration details
    
    <Warning>
    Treat your API keys like secrets — keep them out of client-side code and version control. Store them securely in your backend systems only.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your environment">
    Based on your access level, you'll use one of the following domains:
    
    **Sandbox Environment:**
    - Partner API: `api.partner.dit.myperch.io`
    - Realtor API: `api.realtor.dit.myperch.io`
    
    **Production Environment:**
    - Partner API: `api.partner.myperch.io`
    - Realtor API: `api.realtor.myperch.io`
    
    Always test your integration thoroughly in the sandbox environment before switching to production.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sample request

```http
POST /firmMembers/abc12345/leads HTTP/1.1
Host: api.partner.myperch.io
X-API-Key: your-api-key-here
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "client@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "+1234567890"
}
```

## Security and key management

- **API keys are tied to your firm account** and all requests are logged internally for security and auditing purposes
- **Store them securely** — use environment variables or secure configuration management, never commit them to version control
- **Rotate if compromised** — contact [partnersupport@myperch.io](mailto:partnersupport@myperch.io) immediately if you suspect your key has been compromised
- **Backend only** — never expose API keys in frontend applications, mobile apps, or any client-side code
- **HTTPS required** — all API requests must be made over HTTPS to ensure your API key is transmitted securely

## Troubleshooting authentication

Common authentication issues and solutions:

| Error Code | Description | Solution |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | No valid API key provided | Ensure the `X-API-Key` header is included and spelled correctly |
| `403 Forbidden` | API key doesn't have required permissions | Contact support to verify your key's permissions for the requested resource |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded | Implement exponential backoff and respect rate limits |

<Warning>
If you experience persistent authentication issues, verify that you're using the correct domain for your environment (sandbox vs. production) and that your API key matches the environment you're targeting.
</Warning>
