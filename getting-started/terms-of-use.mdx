description: "Terms of Service for using the Perch Partner API"
---

By accessing or using the Perch API (the "API"), you (the "Client") agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service ("TOS"). These terms govern your use of the API, which is provided by Perch (the "Service Provider"). If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the API.

The Perch API enables integration with Perch's platform, providing secure access to its data and services. These TOS are designed to ensure proper use of the API, maintain its security, and protect the interests of both parties.

The Service Provider reserves the right to update or modify these TOS at any time. Significant changes will be communicated, and continued use of the API after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.

<Warning>
Please review the terms carefully, as violations may result in suspension or termination of your API access.
