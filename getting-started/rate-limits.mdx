## Rate limiting

Please take note that requests will be rate limited based on an hourly quota. The quota will allow for burst requests of up to 6x the hourly average quota.

For example, if your quota is 500 requests / hour, then you cannot exceed 50 requests / minute. The hourly quota is rolling, so if you made 500 requests between 07:30 and 07:45, then you must wait until 08:30 before you can continue to use the API.

## Handling rate limits

When you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff to handle this gracefully:

```javascript
async function makeRequestWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, options);
      
      if (response.status === 429) {
        const retryDelay = Math.pow(2, attempt);
        await sleep(retryDelay * 1000);
        continue;
      }
      
      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries - 1) throw error;
      await sleep(Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000);
    }
  }
}
```

## Best practices for rate limiting

1. **Implement exponential backoff** - Start with a 1-second delay and double it with each retry
2. **Respect the rolling window** - Track your request timing to avoid hitting limits
3. **Cache responses** where appropriate to reduce API calls
4. **Batch operations** when possible instead of making many individual requests
5. **Monitor for `429` responses** and adjust your request frequency accordingly

## Understanding your quota

Your specific rate limit depends on your partnership agreement and use case. Common quotas include:

- **Sandbox environment**: Lower limits for testing (typically 100-200 requests/hour)
- **Production environment**: Higher limits based on your integration needs
- **Burst allowance**: Up to 6x your hourly average in a short period

If you need higher rate limits for your integration, contact [partnersupport@myperch.io](mailto:partnersupport@myperch.io) to discuss your requirements.

## Rate limiting scenarios

### Normal usage
```javascript
// Making requests within limits
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  const response = await makeRequest(`/leads/${leadIds[i]}`);
  // Process response
}
```

### Handling rate limit exceeded
```javascript
// Proper error handling for rate limits
try {
  const response = await makeRequest('/leads');
} catch (error) {
  if (error.status === 429) {
    console.log('Rate limit exceeded, waiting before retry...');
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 60000)); // Wait 1 minute
    // Retry the request
  }
}
```
