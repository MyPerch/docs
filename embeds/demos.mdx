## Implementation

Each embed uses the same simple integration pattern with a unique widget ID:

```html
<div class="perch-widget" widget-id="your-widget-id">
<!-- Replace the inner content with custom loader -->
<div class="perch-widget-loading-indicator" style="text-align: center;">Loading...</div>
</div>
<script src="https://embeds.myperch.io/assets/perch-embed-widget.js"></script>
```
