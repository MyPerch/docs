## About the Lead Management Embed

The Lead Management embed streamlines client mortgage financing so you can focus on what you do best. Whether you're closing real estate deals, handling legal wrap-ups, or coordinating insurance, this embed manages your clients' mortgage journey from referral to funding while keeping you informed at each key milestone.

**Included widgets:**
- **Lead Submission Widget** - Submit client referrals using a branded form
- **Lead Review Widget** - Track financing progress in real time from pre‑approval through funding

## What Is a Lead?

A lead is simply a warm introduction to someone who needs mortgage support. When you submit a client via the embed, here's what happens automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Submit leads** with basic client info (name, email, financing need)
2. **Automated follow-up** - Perch contacts clients to confirm interest  
3. **Lead conversion** - Clients automatically become **plans** when they sign up
4. **Progress tracking** - Monitor stages like **Pre‑approval → Approved → Funded**
5. **Pipeline management** - Unconverted leads are archived
