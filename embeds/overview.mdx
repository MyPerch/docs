## How embedding works

The process of embedding a Perch Tool is straightforward and similar across different platforms. Your Perch representative will provide you with a simple code snippet that you can paste into your website.

### Basic embed structure

Your code snippet will include two parts:

```html
<!-- Widget container -->
<div class="perch-widget" widget-id="YOUR-WIDGET-ID">
    <div class="perch-widget-loading-indicator">Loading...</div>
</div>

<!-- Widget script -->
<script src="https://embeds.myperch.io/assets/perch-embed-widget.js"></script>
```

<Warning>
This is just an example. Your Perch representative will provide your specific widget ID and code.
</Warning>
