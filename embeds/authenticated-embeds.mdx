## About Authenticated Embeds

Authenticated embeds provide a ready-made UI alternative to API integration. While our public widgets offer general tools like mortgage calculators and rate displays, authenticated embeds access sensitive data and personalized functionality that requires secure user login—things like client information, lead tracking, and firm-specific workflows.

**Features:**
- User authentication with role-based access
- Custom widget combinations  
- Branded experience
- Public URLs or embedded deployment
- No development required (alternative to API integration)

<Note>
We recognize that not every team has the technical resources for Public API integration. That's why we're developing embedded versions of our tools—to expand accessibility and support diverse workflows. Have a use case in mind? Contact [partnersupport@myperch.io](mailto:partnersupport@myperch.io).
