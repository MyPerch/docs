## Overview

In its simplest form, Perch's Partner API is a realtime gateway that provides Perch's Referral Partners with a simple way to refer mortgage seekers (i.e. [Lead](https://docs.myperch.io/docs/partner-web-api/branches/main/d1a4cf0d134e3-lead)) to Perch and track their progress as they move through the mortgage application lifecycle.

## Common API Use Cases

### Submitting & Tracking a Lead

Perch has a long standing referral ecosystem that has provided our Realtors and Partners with a simple method to direct clients toward our digital mortgage brokering services. Historically, partners have driven these "leads" (i.e. an individual interested in applying for mortgage) to Perch through the use of our referral code links and landing pages.

While the use of these channels do provide a reliable method to track inbound leads and attribute them to the referring party, they typically yield suboptimal conversion results as they are not personalized and untethered from any form of automation and/or integration. Furthermore, while referral codes do enable lead attribution, partners still lack visibility into whether or not the lead actually converted (i.e. signed up and started and/or funded a mortgage with Perch).

This is where our API comes into play. Instead of directing a client to a landing page or referral link, a partner can directly and securely submit a client's details to Perch in the form of a **`Lead`**. In turn, our lead system will automatically deploy our tailored onboarding experience; a bespoke combination of automation and customer experience representative intervention. This highly scrutinized and continuously refined workflow continues to yield substantially higher rates of funding success than our traditional referral channels.

Additionally, when creating a **`Lead`** a partner will also be able to provide additional details to proactively enrich that lead's client details (e.g. marital status, employment or residence history, debts and assets, etc.) and include the mortgage(s) the client is seeking (in Perch we call these **`Plan`**s).

### Benefits of Programmatic Lead Submission

By programmatically providing these additional details a partner can:

- Further personalize, simplify and expedite a client's application experience
- Dramatically reduce barriers to lead conversion

Finally, the partner will be able to check the status of both the **`Lead`** and the **`Plan`** (assuming they are tagged as the referring party on the plan) through the use of the pertaining restful endpoints.

## Creating a Lead

Creating a lead is simple and can be accomplished through the use of our "Create a Lead" (**`POST /parentResources/:id/leads`**) restful endpoint. A lead can either be created on behalf of:

- **A specific user** (e.g. a realtor; which we refer to as a **`FirmMember`** with **`firmType: 'Realty'`**): **`POST /firmMembers/:firmMemberId/leads`**
- **A Firm**: **`POST /firms/:firmId/leads`**

For more information on creating a **`Lead`**, please see the [Partner API documentation](/partner/api-documentation).
